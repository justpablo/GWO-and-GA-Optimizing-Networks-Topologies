### Description: 
                1. Motivation: It is well known that it is possible to obtain a variety of complex network topologies with very interesting properties by growing graphs. An example of this is the Barabási-Albert model, which uses a preferential attachment mechanism to generate scale-free networks. Considering this particular fact, the main aim of our project is showing that similar real network topologies can be obtained as a result of a combinatorial optimization task, represented as a minimization problem. After reviewing carefully similar problem literature, we found that the most representative objectives to be optimized are: link density and average shortest distance, in order to generate different network topologies. Furthermore, problems that involve more than one objective have to be tackle with a multi-objective framework, in which the optimization technique considers a distribution of weights between the optimization task objectives.

                2. Previous work: Former work on this tasks involve the application of a basic scheme minimization algorithm that basically perform small changes in the evolution of the topology through the time without any specific criteria.

                3. Our contribution: In our work we are trying to analyze behavior of the network topology evolution for different configuration of weights applying one classical swarm intelligence technique, Genetic Algorithms, and a modern swarm intelligence approach, Grey Wolf Optimizer. We consider parameters and optimization techniques tuning expecting a good behavior in terms of topology evolution. The final goal is to establish comparisons among the basic scheme optimization method and the algorithms proposed in this work.
